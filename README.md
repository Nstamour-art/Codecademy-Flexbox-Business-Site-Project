# Flexbox Business Site

This project is part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course, specifically the HTML and CSS module. The project demonstrates the use of Flexbox to create a responsive generic business website. I made up a business called **"Future.com"** that is suitably generic and corporate. The images are all generated using ChatGPT 4o and Adobe Firefly Image generation
